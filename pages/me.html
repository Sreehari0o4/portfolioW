        <p>Hi, I'm <span class="about-me-name">Sreehari S Kumar</span></p>
        <p>
            I specialize in <span class="about-me-keyword">front-end web development</span> and <span class="about-me-keyword">UI/UX </span>design, creating digital experiences that are clean, functional, and human-centered. I enjoy turning ideas into reality through thoughtful design and clean code.

            My curiosity doesn’t stop at the front end. I'm also passionate about <span class="about-me-keyword">DevOps</span> — learning how to automate, deploy, and scale modern web applications. The blend of creativity and systems thinking drives my work every day.
